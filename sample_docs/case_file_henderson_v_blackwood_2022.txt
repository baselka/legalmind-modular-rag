Case Name: Henderson v. Blackwood Industries, Inc.
Case Number: 2022-CV-04521
Court: United States District Court, Southern District of New York
Filed: June 8, 2022
Client: Robert Henderson
Matter ID: HEN-2022-0608

CASE SUMMARY
Plaintiff Robert Henderson ("Henderson") brings this action against Blackwood Industries, Inc.
("Blackwood") for wrongful termination, breach of employment contract, and violation of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act whistleblower protection provisions, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A.

FACTS
Henderson was employed by Blackwood as Vice President of Finance from January 2018 until his
termination on April 30, 2022. During Q4 2021, Henderson discovered what he reasonably believed
to be securities fraud: Blackwood's CFO, Marcus Reeves, had directed the accounting team to
improperly capitalize operating expenses, inflating reported earnings by approximately $4.2 million.

Henderson reported his concerns internally to the Audit Committee on February 14, 2022. On
March 1, 2022, he filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sixty days later,
on April 30, 2022, Blackwood terminated Henderson's employment, citing "restructuring."

LEGAL CLAIMS
Count I: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (18 U.S.C. § 1514A)
  - Henderson engaged in protected activity by reporting suspected securities violations
  - The 60-day proximity between the SEC complaint and termination creates a strong inference
    of retaliatory intent
  - Blackwood's stated reason (restructuring) is pretextual -- Henderson's position was
    subsequently filled by an internal candidate

Count II: Breach of Employment Contract
  - Henderson's employment agreement dated January 5, 2018 contains a clause requiring
    "cause" for termination, defined in Section 4.2 as gross misconduct, conviction of a felony,
    or willful neglect of duties
  - None of these conditions were met
  - Henderson is entitled to 12 months severance pay per Section 7.1 of the agreement

Count III: Defamation
  - Blackwood's general counsel stated to Henderson's subsequent prospective employer that
    Henderson was "terminated for financial irregularities" -- a false statement made with
    knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for the truth

DAMAGES
  - Back pay: approximately $340,000 (10 months at $408,000 annual salary)
  - Front pay: approximately $816,000 (estimated 24 months to equivalent re-employment)
  - Compensatory damages for emotional distress: TBD
  - Punitive damages under SOX: up to $250,000
  - Attorneys' fees and costs

  1. Employment Agreement (Jan 5, 2018) -- signed by Henderson and CEO Patricia Blackwood
  2. Internal Audit Committee memo (Feb 14, 2022)
  3. SEC whistleblower complaint (Mar 1, 2022) -- confidential
  4. Termination letter (Apr 30, 2022)
